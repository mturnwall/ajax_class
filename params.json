{"body":"## Purpose\r\nThis javascript object is written to allow a developer to make ajax calls for any project without having to write custom response handlers for every project. With just a single ajax call you can update multiple parts of a page regardless if you updating code or just content. In fact you can update code blocks on one portion of a page, just content on another portion, and even form fields on a page all with a single ajax call.\r\n\r\nThe magic is accomplished by using a standardized JSON model. This JSON model holds key:value pairs where the key is the ID of an element on a page to update and the value portion is the code or content that will be placed into the page.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:  \r\n\r\n    {\r\n        \"head\": {\r\n\t\t\"status\": 200,\r\n\t\t\"data\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"code\": 400,\r\n\t\t\t\"message\": \"message that can be displayed in the browser, useful when an error occurs\"\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t},\r\n\t\"body\": {\r\n\t\t\"update\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"html\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"mainTitle\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"Title Was Updated\"\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"mainPara\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"This paragraph was updated and and it now contains some <strong>HTML</strong>.\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\"replace\": {\r\n\t\t\t\"forms\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"name\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"Michael Turnwall\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t],\r\n\t\t\t\"content\": [\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"id\": \"updateMe\",\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\"value\": \"1234567890\"\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t]\r\n\t\t}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nUsing the ajax object is very simple. Everything is done with just one function call.\r\n\r\n    Digi.ajax.getData(url, [method], [parameters]);\r\n\r\n**url**: this is the URL you are making the Ajax call to.  \r\n**method** [optional]: this is your method of choice which is usually GET or POST. Get is the default  \r\n**parameters** [optional]: this is an object literal so you can pass data to the server.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nRight now jQuery 1.3+ is required. A future version will make the object framework free so you can use it with your framework of choice.","google":"","tagline":"An ajax model that allows multiple portions of a page to be updated with a single ajax call and a standardized JSON model","note":"Don't delete this file!
